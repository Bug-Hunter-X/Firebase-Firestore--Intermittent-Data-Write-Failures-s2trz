# Firebase Firestore Intermittent Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to intermittent data write failures in Firebase Firestore.  The issue involves the `set()` method seemingly succeeding, but the data not being written to the database. This occurs inconsistently, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.js` file contains the code that exhibits the problem. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code and explanation of the solution.

## Bug Description
Intermittent data write failures to Firestore. The `set()` method returns a success message, yet the data is not persistently stored in the database. This behavior is unpredictable.

## Solution
The primary cause was determined to be related to asynchronous operations and improper error handling. The solution involves robust error handling and confirmation of successful writes using the Firestore console or dedicated data verification methods.
